0. After unpacking the icmake_X.YY.tar.gzicmake archive, make your current
   working directory equal to the directory in which you found this file.

1. Inspect and modify if necessary the current locations in INSTALL.im.

2. If you want the compiler to insert debugging code in the icmake programs
   then define a CFLAGS environment variable. E.g., 
                   CFLAGS="-Wall -O2 -g"

3. Create the icmake installation files:
                   ./icm_bootstrap /

4. To install, do as root:
                    ./icm_install strip all /
                    
5. Remove intermediate construction area:
                    rm -rf tmp
