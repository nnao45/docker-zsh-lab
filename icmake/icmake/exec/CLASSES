# This file contains the names of all subdirectories containing sources to
# compile. Each directory should be specified on a line of its own. Initial
# blanks are ok. Compilation is 1-level deep. 

# If a parser or scanner is used, (see icmconfig's USE_PARSER and USE_SCANNER
# defines) then those directories are automatically included (although they
# could be included here as well) 

# Lines starting with # or with // are ignored, as are empty lines.

# sources in the current (i.e., this) directory are also compiled.
