        The following #defines define the names of programs (and their
        flags, if applicable) used by the 'unix' script. Make sure you
        accept the names of the programs, and that these programs are
        available on your system.

        By changing the defines, you change the names of the programs 
        being activated.

// The following two macros are the library manager. That program 
// is started in the unix-script as "AR ARFLAGS library-name object-files".
#define AR              "ar"

// The flags of AR:
#define ARFLAGS         "rsv"

// The C compiler: 
#define CC              "gcc"                   

// The flags of the C compiler:
        //      -c enforces compilation-only; 
        //      -O is used to turn the generation of debugging code
        //         off. Alternatively, -g could be selected to turn 
        //         debugging on.
        // The define -DHAVE_GLOB should be used only if your library
        // supports the glob() function. See also the icmake.doc file
        // for further details. The function is normally part of the
        // gcc library.
#define CFLAGS          "-c -Wall -O2 -DHAVE_GLOB"

// The icmake.1 compressor. This results in plain compression of icmake.1
// into icmake.1.Z
#define GZIP            "gzip"

// The program to install the final icm* executables 
// ('cp' does nicely, 'install' should be ok too)
#define CP              "cp"

// The program making the 'bin' subdirectory
#define MKDIR           "mkdir"

// The program used to remove unneccesary files:
#define RM              "rm"

// The strip program, to shrink the final executables somewhat:
#define STRIP           "strip"

/* That's it ! */
