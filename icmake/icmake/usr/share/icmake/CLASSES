# This file contains the names of all subdirectories containing sources to
# compile. Each directory should be specified on a line of its own. Initial
# blanks are ok. Compilation is 1-level deep. 

# If a parser or scanner is used, (see icmconfig's USE_PARSER and USE_SCANNER
# defines) then those directories are automatically included (although they
# could be included here as well) 

# Lines starting with # or with // are ignored, as are empty lines.

# sources in the current (i.e., this) directory are also compiled.

# If a class Y depends on class X as in:
#   class Y: public X
# or:
#   class Y 
#   { 
#       X d_y; 
#   };
# then specify the dependency here using the form
#   y   x
# where x and y are the directories holding the resp. class sources. Multiple
#   dependencies are OK. Then, when altering X's data organization, do 'touch
#   x/a', followed by 'icmbuild program': x's sources as well as the sources in 
#   directories (in)directly depending on x (e.g., y) are then automatically 
#   recompiled by icmbuild.
