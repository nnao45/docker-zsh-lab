.PP 
.SH "NAME"
icmbuild \- A generic, easy configurable, program maintenance script
.PP 
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBicmbuild\fP \fImode\fP
.PP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP 
The \fBicmbuild\fP script is a generic script that can be used to do program
maintenance using \fBicmake\fP(1)\&. 
.PP 
The script expects two files to be available in the directory where program
maintenance is required, and the \fBicmbuild\fP script should be available in your
path or it should be started as, e\&.g\&., \fI\&./icmbuild\fP
.PP 
\fBIcmbuild\fP assumes that your sources exist in and below a directory in which the
files \fIicmconf\fP and \fICLASSES\fP live\&. The file \fICLASSES\fP contains the
names of all subdirectories in which class\-specific sources are kept\&. The file
\fIicmconf\fP in \fBicmake\fP(1)\(cq\&s distribution offers an example of the
configuration parameters that are used for program maintenance\&. In this latter
file it is assumed that \fBC++\fP sources are maintained, but the \fBicmbuild\fP script
is not restricted to do maintenance for \fBC++\fP programs\&.
.PP 
\fBIcmbuild\fP compiles all sources in each of the subdirectories named in the file
\fICLASSES\fP, and then compiles all sources in the current working directory
(except for the source containing \fImain()\fP)\&.
.PP 
The compiled sources result in object modules which are then kept in a
library, against which the main\-object module is linked\&. It is also possible
to specify additional libraries against which the program must be linked\&.
.PP 
Once a library is constructed it is kept up to date by the script\&. Changing a
source will result in replacing its former module by its new module in the
library\&. 
.PP 
.SH "KICK\-STARTING ICMBUILD"

.PP 
Normally, \fBicmbuild\fP is installed and used as follows:
.IP o 
Install \fBicmbuild\fP in your path;
.IP o 
copy \fIicmconf\fP and \fICLASSES\fP to your project\(cq\&s base directory
(i\&.e\&., the directory in which and where below the project\(cq\&s sources are
found);
.IP o 
Modify the \fI#defines\fP in the file \fIicmconf\fP to taste;
.IP o 
List the subdirectories containing sources in the file \fICLASSES\fP
.IP 
Note that the order of the classes mentioned in classes \fIis\fP relevant
here\&.  It\(cq\&s no problem to add new class (subdirectory) names, but
reordering should be prevented\&. If reordering is required, recompile
the library, as the final object files contain class order\-numbers\&.
These class\-order numbers prevent file\-name collisions and thus prevent
replacing file \fIx\&.o\fP from class \fIA\fP by file \fIx\&.o\fP from class
\fIB\fP;
.IP o 
Now simply run 
.nf 

            icmbuild 
        
.fi 
from the project\(cq\&s base directory and let the help\-info tell you
what your options are\&. See the next section for the modes of operation\&.

.PP 
.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP 
\fBIcmbuild\fP may be called with the following operational modes:
.IP o 
\fIclean\fP
.br 
clean up remnants of previous activities
.IP o 
\fIhelp\fP
.br 
provide help and exit (default when called without arguments)
.IP o 
\fIlibrary\fP
.br 
build the library (static and optionally the dynamic library)
.IP o 
\fIprogram\fP
.br 
build the binary program
.IP o 
\fIprogram strip\fP
.br 
build the stripped binary program
.IP o 
\fIinstall <base>\fP
install the software in the locations defined in the \fIicmconf\fP
file, optionally below the directory \fI<base>\fP
The \fBicmconf\fP file may be given a line defining \fIDEFCOM\fP containing
the default operational mode to use when none is specified\&. E\&.g\&.,
.nf 

    #define DEFCOM \(dq\&program\(dq\&
        
.fi 
constructs the program when the command `\fIicmbuild\fP\(cq\& is
entered\&. \fIDEFCOM\fP may also contain combined options, like 
.nf 

    #define DEFCOM \(dq\&program strip\(dq\&
        
.fi 
Note that \fIDEFCOM\fP is ignored when an explicit operational mode is
provided to the \fBicmbuild\fP script\&.
.PP 
.SH "FILES"

.PP 
The mentioned paths are sugestive only and may be installation dependent:
.IP o 
\fB/usr/share/icmake/icmconf\fP
Example of a \fBicmbuild\fP configuration file;
.IP o 
\fB/usr/share/icmake/CLASSES\fP
Example of a \fBicmbuild\fP \fICLASSES\fP file\&.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.PP 
Here is an example of the configuration file \fIicmconf\fP for a concrete
program, using the library \fIlibbobcat1\fP as an additional library:
.PP
