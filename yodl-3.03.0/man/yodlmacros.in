manpagesynopsis()
            This manual page lists the standard macros of the Yodl package.

manpagedescription()
            The following list shows the macros defined by the Yodl converters
define and which can be used in Yodl documents. Refer to the Yodl user
guide, distributed with the Yodl package, for a full description.

bf(NOTE:) Starting with Yodl version 3.00.0 Yodl's default file inclusion
behavior has changed. The current working directory no longer remains fixed at
the directory in which Yodl is called, but is volatile, changing to the
directory in which a yodl-file is located. This has the advantage that Yodl's
file inclusion behavior now matches the way bf(C)'s tt(#include) directive
operates; it has the disadvantage that it may break some current
documents. Conversion, however is simple but can be avoided altogether if
Yodl's tt(-L) (tt(--legacy-include)) option is used. This affects the
tt((l)includefile, includeverbatim, notransinclude) and tt(verbinclude) macros
(see below).

The following list shows all macros of the package in alphabetical
        order.

manpageoptions()
    No options are relevant in respect to the macros.

manpagefiles()
    The files in bf(@STD_INCLUDE@) define the converter's macro packages. The
scripts bf(yodl2tex), bf(yodl2html), bf(yodl2man) etc. perform the
conversions.
