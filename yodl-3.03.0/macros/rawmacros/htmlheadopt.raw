macro(htmlheadopt(option))
(Adds the literal text tt(option) to the current information in the tt(head)
section of an HTML document. tt(Option) may (or: should) contain plain html
text. A commonly occurring head option is tt(link), defining, e.g., a style
sheet. Since that option is frequently used, it has received a dedicated 
macro: tt(htmlstylesheet). Like tt(htmlbodyopt) this macro should be placed in
the document's preamble.
