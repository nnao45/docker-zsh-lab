(With the LaTeX() convertor, no tt(clearpage()) instruction is inserted
immediately beyond the document's table of contents. The tt(clearpage())
instruction is default in all but the tt(article) document type. When present,
must appear bf(before) stating the document type with tt(article), tt(book) or
tt(report).) With other convertors than the LaTeX() convertor, it is ignored.)
