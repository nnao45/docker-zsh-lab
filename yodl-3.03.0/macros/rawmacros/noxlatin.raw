macro(noxlatin())
(When used in the preamble, the LaTeX converter disables the inclusion of the
file tt(xlatin1.tex). Normally this file gets included in the LateX output
files to ensure the conversion of high ASCII characters (like \'e) to
LaTeX-understandable codes. (The file tt(xlatin1.tex) comes with the YODL
distribution.))
