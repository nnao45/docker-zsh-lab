macro(titleclearpage())
(Forces the generation of a tt(clearpage()) directive following the title of a
document. This is already the default in tt(book)s and tt(report)s, but can be
overruled with tt(notitleclearpage()). When present, must appear in the
em(preamble); i.e., before the document type is stated with tt(article),
tt(book) or tt(report).)
