macro(setchapterstring(name))
(Defines tt(name) as the `chapter' string, by default em(Chapter). E.g., after
tt(setchapterstring(Hoofdstuk)), YODL gains some measure of national language
support for Dutch. Note that LaTeX support has its own NLS, this macro doesn't
affect the way LaTeX output looks.)
