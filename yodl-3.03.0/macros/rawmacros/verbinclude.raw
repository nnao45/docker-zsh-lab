macro(verbinclude(filename))
(Reads filename and inserts it literally in the text, set in verbatim mode.
not subject to macro expansion.The text appears literally on the output,
usually in a teletype font (that depends on the output format). This macro is
an alternative to tt(verb(...)), when the text to set in verbatim mode is
better kept in a separate file.

bf(NOTE:) Starting with Yodl version 3.00.0 Yodl's default file inclusion
behavior has changed. The current working directory no longer remains fixed at
the directory in which Yodl is called, but is volatile, changing to the
directory in which a yodl-file is located. This has the advantage that Yodl's
file inclusion behavior now matches the way bf(C)'s tt(#include) directive
operates; it has the disadvantage that it may break some current
documents. Conversion, however is simple but can be avoided altogether if
Yodl's tt(-L) (tt(--legacy-include)) option is used.)
