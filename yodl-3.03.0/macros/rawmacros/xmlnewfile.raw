macro(xmlnewfile())
(In XML output, starts a new file. All other formats are not affected. Note
that you must take your own provisions to access the new file; say via links.
Also, it's safe to start a new file just befoore opening a new section, since
sections are accessible from the clickable table of contents. The XML
converter normally only starts new files prior to a tt(chapter) definition.)
