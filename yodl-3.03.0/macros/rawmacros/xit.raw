macro(xit(itemname)) (Starts an xml menu item where the file to
which the menu refers to is the argument of the NOTRANS(xit()) macro. It
should be used as argument to NOTRANS(xmlmenu()), which has a 3rd argument:
the default path prefixed to the NOTRANS(xit()) elements. 

This macro is only available
within the xml-conversion mode. The argument must be a full filename,
including .xml extension, if applicable.

No .xml extension indicates a subdirectory, containing another sub-menu.)
