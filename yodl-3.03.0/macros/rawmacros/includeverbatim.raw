macro(includeverbatim(file))
(Include tt(file) into the output.  No processing is done, tt(file) should
be in preformatted form, e.g.: verb(whenhtml(includeverbatim(foo.html)))

bf(NOTE:) Starting with Yodl version 3.00.0 Yodl's default file inclusion
behavior has changed. The current working directory no longer remains fixed at
the directory in which Yodl is called, but is volatile, changing to the
directory in which a yodl-file is located. This has the advantage that Yodl's
file inclusion behavior now matches the way bf(C)'s tt(#include) directive
operates; it has the disadvantage that it may break some current
documents. Conversion, however is simple but can be avoided altogether if
Yodl's tt(-L) (tt(--legacy-include)) option is used.)
