macro(htmlnewfile())
(In HTML output, starts a new file. All other formats are not affected. Note
that you must take your own provisions to access the new file; say via links.
Also, it's safe to start a new file just befoore opening a new section, since
sections are accessible from the clickable table of contents. The HTML
converter normally only starts new files prior to a tt(chapter) definition.)
