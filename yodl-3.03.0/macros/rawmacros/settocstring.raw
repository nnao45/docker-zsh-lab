macro(settocstring(name))
(Defines tt(name) as the `table of contents' string, by default em(Table of
Contents). E.g., after tt(settocstring(Inhalt)), YODL identifies the table
of contents in the German way. Note that LaTeX output does its own national
language support; this macro doesn't affect the way LaTeX output looks.)
