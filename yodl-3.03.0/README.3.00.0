To get the pre-3.00.0 include behavior, use the -L (--legacy-include) option

All documents that were correctly processed using a pre-3.00.0 Yodl release
should be processed by Yodl-3.00.0 if the -L flag is used. 

To convert from the pre-3.00.0 include behavior to the 3.00.0 include behavior
make sure that all includefile(), verbinclude() and verbinsert() file
specifications are relative to the directory of the file in which the
includefile(), verbinclude() or verbinsert() macro is used or use absolute
filepaths.

All this assumes that . is in your current search path, of course.
