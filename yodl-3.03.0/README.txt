This is the toplevel README to Yodl

Yodl is a package that implements a pre-document language
and tools to process it.  The idea of Yodl is that you write
up a document in a pre-language, then use the tools (e.g.
yodl2html) to convert it to some final document language.
Current converters are for HTML, ms, man, LaTeX, a simple
txt converter and an experimental XML converter.  Main 
document types are "article", "book", "letter", "manpage"
and  "report". The Yodl document language is designed to be 
easy to use and extensible.
